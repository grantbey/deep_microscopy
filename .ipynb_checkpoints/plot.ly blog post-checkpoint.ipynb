    "# Streaming results from keras to plot.ly\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been doing a lot of work in Keras recently, and as with all things deep learning it's helpful to track the loss and accuracy metrics of your algorithm *during* training. If you're using Tensorflow you can simply use [Tensorboard](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tensorboard/README.md) to graph everything. Unfortunately, I was using the Theano backend so I had to get creative.\n",
    "\n",
    "This then serves as a small guide to how I achieved what I needed for my purposes. In a nutshell, I used the callbacks functions in Keras to initialize a streaming connection [plot.ly](http://plot.ly), and then at the end of each epoch I updated the graph. I also wrote a little heartbeat thread to keep the connection open durring training.\n",

To counter this, the stream objects also have a `heartbeat()` method which keeps the connection alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used Python's threading package to start a new thread with a while loop that sends a heartbeat to each stream every five seconds, ensuring that the connections don't close between epochs. The thread runs as a daemon, allowing the rest of the processes to continue while this happens in the background. The threading event object allows begins as *not* \"set\", and can be changed to \"set\" using it's `set()` method. I simply call this at the end of training and the while loop terminates, ending the thread.\n",

    "Now that everything is set up, I'm ready to make the callback class that Keras will use during training. Keras has a list of callbacks that you can take advantage of at the beginning and end of training, each epoch, and each batch.I'll start with `on_train_begin()` and open the streams, start the heartbeater thread and initialize empty lists for the logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, using `on_epoch_end()`, I update the logs with the latest metric and loss values, and use the stream objects' `write()` method to send the data to plot.ly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we use `on_train_end()` to wrap things up. Here, I redefined the traces but without streams this time. Additionally, I supply the traces with full x and y values from the logs. I'm basically plotting the graph staticallly. I made new layout, data and figure objects with these new traces and then sent the plot to plot.ly using `py.plot()`. Since the `filename` argument is the same as the stream, this figure will replace the stream figure that has been developing as we train. Thus, the plot at this URL will be a streaming plot *while* training and then a static plot once training is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this last step is simple:  when I start training a new network, I'll start streaming again (albeit to a new graph, with a unique filename) and the data on this graph will be lost. I'm not sure why this happens, it seems crazy to me, but it does. This last step creates a regular plot.ly graph with all the data on it for posterity purposes. Now you can tweak the learning rate or add more dropout, train again and see if the network behaves differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, it's possible to include the argument `fileopts='extend'` in the `py.plot()` call, which causes plot.ly to append any new data to an existing plot (if the `filename` argument matches an existing file, otherwise a new file is created). This could be used if you decide to load weights from a previously trained model and train for more epochs. The `model.fit()` method has an argument `initial_epoch` which allows you to specify where to start training from. Be careful here with the x values of your graph - if they get out of sync between runs the resulting plot have odd overlaps.\n",
